          <p>
            I must confess that after spending a month living on Robinson Crusoe
            Island earlier this year, I was convinced I could never be “wowed”
            by my travels again. I experienced weeks of intense withdrawal
            symptoms, spent days not wanting to get out of a four-walled room,
            missed deadlines, and reached out to a therapist to try to figure
            out how I could claw my way back into the real world. Her advice
            didn’t help, but the universe found me a way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d already said no to two potential travel assignments, unexcited
            by the prospect of a meaningless trip and more flying emissions. But
            Switzerland Tourism had a unique proposition for me: My partner and
            I would try out one of the country’s newest sustainable tourism
            offerings – Route 1291, a 7 day e-biking adventure across the
            magnificent Swiss Alps! Having experienced a bit of wintry
            Switzerland a few years ago, and tried short distance e-biking in
            Austria and Goa, I knew the two would make an epic combination. But
            I could never guess just how epic. After the initial excitement of
            being invited on our first “Swisstainable” self-guided, multi-day
            cycling trip, I was pretty damn nervous about our ability to cycle
            50-80 km daily and pedal up some of Switzerland’s highest Alpine
            passes. But as the journey began, I quickly realized that every drop
            of sweat and every sore muscle would be worth the reward – rugged
            karst mountain scenery, turquoise blue lakes, idyllic Swiss
            villages, mist-clad peaks, ancient churches, gushing rivers and
            streams, meadows bursting with wildflowers.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            Besides, our Swiss-made Flyer ebikes were just brilliant, with upto
            100 km battery life in eco mode – making this long distance cycling
            trip challenging but quite doable on a moderate fitness level.
            Looking back, it’s hard to put in words the feeling of climbing up
            hair pin bends (thank heavens it was an e-bike!) to high mountain
            passes, flying down long downhills in the cool Alpine breeze, and
            pedaling from destination to destination without any motorized
            transport.

          How to organize a self-guided ebiking trip in Switzerland
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our trip was organized by Eurotrek, an active holidays company based
          in Switzerland. Their route maps and descriptions were extremely
          helpful for a first-time self-guided trip across Switzerland. And we
          really appreciated their luggage transport service!
        </p>
        <h3 class="p-20">How to find the way:</h3>
        <p>
          Signposting, Swiss Mobility App, Google maps We found the Swiss
          Mobility app (Schweiz Mobil) a bit hard to navigate, but the trails
          are brilliantly signposted all along. With some help from google maps,
          we never got too lost.

        <h3 class="p-20">How to prevent a sore butt while cycling!</h3>
        <p>
          Long distance cycling can lead to a very sore butt. I bought a pair of
          padded cycling shots from Decathlon, and though not eco-friendly, they
          were a life saver, especially over 7 continuous days of cycling. I
          hope to use them for all future cycling trips.
